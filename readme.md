# Binocular stereo vision system model

Abstract: this repo includes modeling of binocular stereo vision system and an algorithm for 2D -> 3D mapping.

## Description
In this repo we model binocular stereo vision system consisting of two cameras of the same specification, the same focal length, the same aperture and the same sensor area of the camera. Also, the left and right cameras remain in the same plane, thus ensuring that the horizontal axes of the left and right camera systems are on the same line and parallel to the imaging plane, as shown on the picture below. 

We know extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, so we know a lot.
More - in the notebook.

I'm attaching several good papers on the subject.
